## Steps
* Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishna25092005/hospital-management-system.git
cd Hospital-Management-System
```
* Set Up MySQL Database:
  * Create a new database named 'mydb'.
  * Run the following SQL script to create the required table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE patients (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    medical_condition VARCHAR(255),
    severity INT,
    bed_id INT
);
```
* Compile the Program:
  Use a C++ compiler to compile the program. For example, using  MinGW:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o HospitalManagementSystem -lmysql
```
* Run the Program:
```bash
./HospitalManagementSystem
```
